<h5>Read the passage carefully:</h5>
<p>Most human beings are awake during the day and sleep at night. Owls live the opposite way. Owls are nocturnal. This means that they sleep all day and stay awake at night. Because owls are nocturnal, this means they must eat at night. But finding food in the dark is difficult. To help them, they have special eyes and ears.</p>
<p>Owls have very large eyes. These eyes absorb more light than normal. Since there is little light during the night, it is helpful to be able to absorb more of it. This helps owls find food in the dark.</p>
<p>Owls also have very good hearing. Even when owls are in the trees, they can hear small animals moving in the grass below. This helps owls catch their prey even when it is very dark.</p>
<p>Like owls, mice are also nocturnal animals. Mice have an excellent sense of smell. This helps them find food in the dark.</p>
<p>Being nocturnal helps mice to hide from many different animals that want to eat them. Most of the birds, snakes and lizards that like to eat mice sleep at night — except, of course, owls!</p>
